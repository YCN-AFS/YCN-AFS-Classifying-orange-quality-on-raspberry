# YCN-AFS-Classifying-orange-quality-on-raspberry
This project aims to develop an automated orange quality classification system using a Raspberry Pi and machine learning. The system will capture images of oranges using a Raspberry Pi camera and then use a trained machine learning model to classify the oranges based on quality criteria such as size, color, shape, and defects.
